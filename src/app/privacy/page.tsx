      <Prose>
        <p>
          Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we collect when you
          visit {siteConfig.name}, why we collect it, and the choices you have. We keep it short and
          plain.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the minimum amount of information needed to run the site:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage data</strong> — anonymous, aggregated analytics (pages visited, device
            type, approximate region). This never includes your name, email, or IP-identifiable
            browsing history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information you submit</strong> — your name and email when you contact us,
            subscribe to the newsletter, or suggest a tool. We only use it to respond to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preferences</strong> — your theme preference (light/dark) and newsletter
            subscription status are stored on your device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To respond to messages and process tool suggestions.</li>
          <li>To send the newsletter you explicitly subscribed to — no third-party lists, ever.</li>
          <li>To understand which tools and articles are useful, and improve the directory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What we never do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We never sell your personal data.</li>
          <li>We never share your email with advertisers or sponsors.</li>
          <li>We never use tracking pixels or cross-site advertising profiles.</li>
          <li>We don&apos;t require an account to browse the directory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use a small number of cookies: a preference cookie for your theme, and optional
          analytics cookies if you consent. You can manage or delete cookies at any time in your
          browser settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Contact messages are kept for up to 12 months, then deleted. Newsletter data is kept until
          you unsubscribe — every email includes a one-click unsubscribe link.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your
          personal data. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.author.email}`}>{siteConfig.author.email}</a> and we&apos;ll
          respond within 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party links</h2>
        <p>
          The directory links to external tools and sites. We&apos;re not responsible for their
          privacy practices — check their policies when you visit them.
        </p>

        <h2>Children&apos;s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          {siteConfig.name} is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect
          personal information from them.
        </p>

        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>
          We follow security best practices to protect the site and your data. All traffic is served
          over HTTPS, we never store passwords or sensitive credentials, and we keep our
          dependencies updated. If you discover a security issue, please report it to{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.author.email}`}>{siteConfig.author.email}</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy as the site evolves. Material changes will be announced in our
          changelog. Continued use of the site after changes means you accept the revised policy.
        </p>
